# Learning-Techniques-for-IDS

Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Artificial Neural Network, Random Forest and Gradient Boosting techiques have been analysed and evaluated in order to understand their effectiveness in proper detection of intrusions.

Two datasets, KddCup99 and NSL-KDD have been used for evaluation. 
The datasets can be sourced from 

“KDD Cup 1999 Data”, Available at: http://kdd.ics.uci.edu/databases/kddcup99/kddcup99.html.
“NSL-KDD Dataset”, Available at: https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/nsl.html

The different python files represent various processing of the datasets.
